This directory contains an example bash script for performing each of the use cases of the MaaS component. Notice the existence of a global variable, the hostname of the MaaS service.

There are four directories with the following contents:
- ai_engine: it contains the bash scripts for the AI Engine use cases
- ai_engine_version: it contains the bash scripts for the AI Engine Version use cases
- ai_models: it contains the bash scripts for the AI Model use cases
- evaluation_metrics: it contains the bash scripts for the Evaluation Metric use cases
- generic_files: it contains the bash scripts for the Generic Files use cases

Use bash from the parent directories (not this root directory) for running the multiple scripts.
